            <p class="cost-mobile">$79 / month</p>
            <p class="description-mobile">
            Laizu is a 24 year old sewing machine operator from a poor agricultural background. At her age, had she remained in her village, she would likely have had an arranged marriage in exchange for dowry money. However, as for many other female factory workers, garment work has brought Laizu a newfound independence.

            <p class="cost-mobile">$78 / month</p>
            <p class="description-mobile">
            Sharif is a woman born in the body of a man. In Bangladesh, most hijras - the name given to the ‘third gender’ community - earn their living by begging on the streets. Far from the system of purdah where men and women should be kept apart, the mixing of the sexes in the factories have helped give Sharif a role in society.

            <p class="cost-mobile">$78 / month</p>
            <p class="description-mobile">
            Making Western clothes every day in the factory has opened Ema’s eyes to trends in the Western world. A fashionista and an avid follower of the latest trends on social media, she loves the clothes that she makes. However, these clothes are only for foreign people or college girls - not for poor, working class girls like her.

            <p class="cost-mobile">$105 / month</p>
            <p class="description-mobile">
            Shampa dreams of being a dancer. Since she was a child, she has been dreaming of being up on stage. However, garment workers aren’t supposed to have these kind of big dreams - working at least 10 hours a day for 6 days a week, she fears she’ll never have time to fulfil her ambitions.

            <p class="cost-mobile">$86 / month</p>
            <p class="description-mobile">
            Nurbanu was working at Rana Plaza the day the building collapsed, killing 1135 people and injuring thousands more in one of the worst disasters of industrial history. She survived the disaster but injuries and nightmares still haunt her. However, she doesn’t have many other choices but to go back to the factory - for an uneducated girl from a poor rural background with three children to support, garment work is the only option she has.

            <h3>Nazma, 42</h3>
            <p class="cost-mobile"></p>
            <p class="description-mobile">
            Nazma started working in the factories when she was 11. At 12, she was fired for protesting against the management and by 14 she had founded her first trade union. Today, she leads more than 100,000 garment workers. Her fight against fashion multinationals and against Bangladesh’s traditionally-minded society has improved the working and living conditions of the garment workers. However, many struggles still lay ahead.
