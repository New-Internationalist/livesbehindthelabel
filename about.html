            <div class="about">
              <p>‘Made in Bangladesh’ has become an instantly recognisable symbol for the eighth most populous country in the world. But what springs to mind when you see ‘Made in Bangladesh’ in the collar of your H&amp;M shirt?</p>
              <p>The media in the West tends to present us with a fairly one-dimensional picture of garment factories: Dickensian working conditions, women crouched over sewing machines working long hours for low wages, unscrupulous employers whose negligence leads to disasters such as the 2013 Rana Plaza collapse that killed 1129 people and left thousands more injured.</p>
              <p>But the stats tell another story: Bangladesh has been enjoying an average of 5-6% annual GDP growth since the 1980s, driven in no small part by the boom in the ready-made garment industry. Bangladesh is now the second biggest garment manufacturer in the world, home to almost five million factory workers who make the clothes we see in the H+M, Zara, Mango, Levis or Primark stores on high streets up and down the country.</p>
              <p>After several decades of consistent growth, the industry now accounts for over three quarters of the country’s export earnings and 14.5% of national GDP. Factory work has lifted millions of rural Bangladeshis out of the cycle of extreme poverty linked to subsistence farming, allowing workers to save money and to send their children to school.</p>
              <p>But this phenomenon is still relatively new: as recently as 1980, the garment industry in Bangladesh was virtually non-existent. Just as in Europe at the dawn of industrialisation, the rise of factory work has brought about radical changes in society, transforming relations between men and women, creating new social classes and changing people’s habits and lifestyles.</p>
              <p>We wanted to hear about some of these changes, in the words of factory workers who are living through this period of rapid transformation.</p>
              <p>To achieve this, we partnered with one of the country’s largest trade unions to run storytelling workshops with 80 garment workers in five different neighbourhoods. During these workshops, we trained workers to interview each other and tell their stories to the rest of the group, discussing these insights collectively to understand how these individual stories relate to the typical worker experience. The result was a series of films that take us beyond the stereotypes to reveal surprising and intimate stories about factory workers’ concerns, hopes and dreams.</p>
